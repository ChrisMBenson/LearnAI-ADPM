    "> **Note:** We created the notebooks for this lab such that you can run them as a jupyter or as a databricks notebook. Typically, if one ran these notebooks jupyter, one would just add the [cell magic](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html) `%matplotlib inline` to have all plots appear in line.  However, this doesn't work in databricks notebooks.  We therefore added `plt.close()` before and `display()` after every plot commands."
