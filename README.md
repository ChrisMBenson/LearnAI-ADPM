# Introduction 
TODO: Give a short introduction of your project. Let this section explain the objectives or the motivation behind this project. 

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:

## Setting up your environment

The instuctor will provide a link to you that you can use for provisioning your environment.

Visit that link, and press the `launch lab` button on the landing page.

This process will take a 2-3 minutes. In case you have an [x2go](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php)
 client installed on your machine, this would be a good time to do so. 
We will use the x2go client to connect to a virtual machine.

Once the lab has launched you should see this page that displays all information you need to log into the provisioned environment for your lab.

Set up a `new session` in x2go, using the credentials you see above. Make sure to set the `session type` to `XFCE`.

Connect to the data science virtual machine. 

Once the remote desktop opens, open the terminal x-term (bottom of screen).

Optional: If you want a more powerful terminal you can install that from the x-term (sudo apt-get install gnome-terminal). 
If you do this, you can close x-term and press the same button on the bottom of the screen to open gnome-terminal instead.

Next, clone the 
[repository](https://github.com/Azure/LearnAI-UsingAItoDetectandPredictAnomaliesinTimeSeriesData) for this course from GitHub.
